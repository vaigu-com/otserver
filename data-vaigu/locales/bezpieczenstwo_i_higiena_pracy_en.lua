A man suffered a heart attack after ingesting Jamaica pepper found in the soup. An agent of the Foundation operating undercover as a police officer decided to notify the Foundation about this incident. Permission was granted to take over SCP-0420, which occurred on the 15th of May in the object's apartment. Amnestic Class A-3 was administered to the occupants of the apartment, Janus XXXXXX and Peter XXXXXX. \n\nObject Description\nSCP-0420 is a woman approximately 50 years old. It's anomalous behavior involves cooking a mysterious soup, even though it does not have access to food items or a kitchen utensils in its cell. The soup pot appears approximately every 2 hours and 3 minutes. The soup, named SCP-0420/1, outwardly appears to be a regular vegetable soup with an assortment of meat and a few grains of Jamaica pepper. However, the meat was examined and found to contain a drumstick from an extinct dodo bird (Raphus cucullatus) from around one year old specimen. The Jamaica pepper also contains unidentified bacteria. It was decided to test the effects of SCP-0420/1 on humans, and as such, two Class D personnel members were used. One was given the soup with the meat, while the other was instructed to ingest a parsley seed. The first individual did not exhibit any psychophysical changes and considered the meat 'very tasty.' However, the second individual died of a heart attack five minutes later. Subsequent examination revealed that the pepper had caused the clotting of all the tester's blood vessels. To this day, the object is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell, guarded by two security personnel, and SCP-0420/1 is to be disposed of whenever it appears. It is possible that the parsley may be related to (REDACTED).",
